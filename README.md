# 🛍️ Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

Hi there! 👋  
This is my very first front-end project — a simple **Amazon clone** built using just **HTML** and **CSS**.

I made this to apply what I’ve been learning and to get more comfortable with building real-world layouts from scratch. It’s a static, front-end-only version, meant to look and feel like the homepage of Amazon — without any backend or JavaScript (yet!).

## ✨ What’s Inside?

This project includes some core sections you'd see on an e-commerce site:

- 🔹 A top navigation bar with links and a search bar
- 🔹 A hero/banner section for promotions
- 🔹 Product cards displayed in a grid layout
- 🔹 A footer section

Everything you see is styled from scratch using CSS. No templates, no frameworks — just raw HTML and CSS.

## 💻 Tech Used

- **HTML5** – for the structure
- **CSS3** – for the styling and layout (including Flexbox & Grid)

## 🎯 What I Learned

Working on this taught me a lot of things, including:

- How to break down a complex website into manageable sections
- Using CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout design
- The importance of reusable class names and clean code
- How to make a static site look polished and professional
